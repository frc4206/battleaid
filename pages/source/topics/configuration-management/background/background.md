# Background

Consider this scenario: you're writing a simple program that rotates a servo a certain number of degrees (maybe to actuate an arm).  You don't know exactly how many degrees it will be exactly, so you initially guess 90째.  You hard code the value.

So you test it out, aaaaand... crap.  It was too much! You change it to 80째 and try again.

Now it's too little! Ok, so it's somewhere in between, 85째 maybe? You try this again and again until you hone in on the perfect value, which turns out to be 83.5째. 

Sound familiar?

## Characterizing the Problem

When building robots, parameters in the software will have to be tested against reality and tweaked on the fly using a guess-and-check strategy.  However, when parameters are hard coded, making changes can be time consuming.  One has to: 

1. Locate all parameter instances in the code.
2. Make the same change for each.
3. Re-build the code.
4. Re-deploy to the robot.

As a robot project grows in complexity and size, this process becomes even more time consuming.  Making small changes will lead to time wasted waiting around for recompilation and re-deployment (which is when your compiled code is sent to the RoboRIO).

For example, if a motor is replaced and the CAN ID needs to be updated, the update should be done as quickly as possible.
