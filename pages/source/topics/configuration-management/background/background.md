# Background

<hr>

Consider this scenario: you're writing a simple program that rotates a servo a certain number of degrees (maybe to actuate an arm).  You don't know exactly how many degrees it will be exactly, so you initially guess 90째.  You hard code the value.

So you test it out, aaaaand... crap.  It was too much! You change it to 80째 and try again.

Now it's too little! Ok, so it's somewhere in between, 85째 maybe? You try this again and again until you hone in on the perfect value, which turns out to be 83.5째.  You finally got the right value, but guessing and checking was tedious.

Sound familiar?

Developing software for dynamic configuration is often ignored due to the short-term cost.  However, the aggregate time-savings far outweigh initial development time.

## Characterizing the Problem

When building robots, parameters in the software will have to be tested against reality and tweaked on the fly.  However, when parameters are hard coded, making changes is not easy.  One has to: 

1. Locate the parameter(s)
2. Make the change(s)
3. Re-build and deploy to the robot

One strategy to make the first step easier is to use a `Constants.java` file containing all parameters with the modifiers `static final` functionally equivalent to global variables.  This strategy has some issues though:

- Deeply nested namespaces (e.g. `Constants.Subsystem.Motor1.PID.kI`)
   - Not always bad, but too much verbosity can be overbearing 
- Lack of clear compartmentalization
   - As the size of `Constants.java` grows, it also becomes harder for readers to parse
   
There is another major issue with `Constants.java`: any changes require re-deployment!  Even making one or two small changes will mean time wasted waiting for code to re-build and then upload to your robot. We need a more efficient strategy!

## Parameterization

Observe that `Constants.java` contains values initialized once and only once: during program startup.  We can move these values into _configuration_ files.  

```{important}
When we use configuration files, the software does not need to be recompiled!  This means we don't have to re-deploy code.
